# Pacman Game in C++ and OpenGL

## Overview
This is a classic Pacman game that I worked on as part of my coursework during my bachelor's degree in 2020. The project is built using **C++** and **OpenGL**. I accidentelly found it on my old drive and decided to share it for educational purposes and to help others interested in game development.

## Note from the Author
This project was developed some time ago, and while all the code is functional and can be compiled with the proper setup, the current Visual Studio project solution might not work as intended due to its age and potential dependency issues. I haven't had the time to verify if the solution works as expected after all these years. All necessary DLLs are included in the game build, but the project might require some manual setup to resolve dependencies within Visual Studio.
